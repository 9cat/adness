<strong>You've won <%= user.lineItems.length %> more ad slot(s) in auction <%= auctionId %>!</strong>

<hr>

<div style="width: 90%; margin: auto;">
  Because an advertiser failed to pay for their ads on time, their slots have become available, and you have a chance to buy them. You have a reduced window of time in which to pay for these ads, but your original bid has been discounted somewhat to offset this. These extra slots are exactly the same as regular slots -- they do not have reduced ad time.

  Please promptly pay for the slot(s) you've won using the invoice link below. This invoice will expire on: <%= expiration %>. If you do not pay in time, you will lose your chance at these slots, though you will not be penalized further.

  Please ensure that the ads you want on the forum are in rotation. Ads submitted and approved but not marked "in rotation" will not be advertised. Once your payment clears and the ad period begins, ads marked "In Rotation" on your profile page will start being displayed in the forum's ad area. If you have more ads than slots, then the forum will randomly rotate between your ads. Your ads can be updated during the ad period, though modifications and new ads require approval.
